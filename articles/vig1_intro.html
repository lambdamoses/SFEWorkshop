</h2>
<p>Data from bulk RNA-seq, single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and spatial
transcriptomics all come from spatially organized tissues (except for
blood), where such spatial organization plays a role in the properties
and functions of the tissues. For this reason, a geographical analogy
may be more adequate than the traditional analogy of the smoothie
vs. fruit salad vs. tart.</p>
<p>Many of you attending this conference in person have traveled to
Seattle, and might explore Seattle after the talks. Bulk RNA-seq is an
averaging assay, and in analogy, you could consider information averaged
over Washington State. For example, on average, Washington State tends
to have fewer sunny days per year than California. However, each state
has diverse climate and weather, and tourists prepare for weather in
individual cities rather than the state average.</p>
<p><img src="vig1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" title="Maps of California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington shown in separate facets and dissociated from space, each colored by the average number of sunny days per year in the state. California and Nevada have more sunny days than Oregon and Washington." alt="Maps of California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington shown in separate facets and dissociated from space, each colored by the average number of sunny days per year in the state. California and Nevada have more sunny days than Oregon and Washington." width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Non-spatial scRNA-seq is like a list of tourist attractions in
Seattle without spatial locations, where each tourist attraction is
analogous to a cell. There’s the Space Needle, the Museum of Pop
Culture, Chihuly Garden and Glass, Smith Tower, Pike Place, Museum of
Flight, and etc. These tourist attractions can also be classified based
on their characteristics, such as architectural style, function, and era
of construction, analogous to gene expression. Dimension reduction can
be performed on these numerous characteristics. Compared to the state
averages, this would be of more interest to a tourist.</p>
<p><img src="seattle_attractions.png" title="Photos of tourist attractions in Seattle dissociated from the geographical locations of these tourist attractions. The tourist attractions include: Living Computers, Museum of Pop Culture, Space Needle, Seattle Museum of Art, Pike Place, Chihuly Glass and Garden, Museum of Flight, Smith Tower, Rainier Tower, University of Washington, Mount Rainier, and Gas Works Park." alt="Photos of tourist attractions in Seattle dissociated from the geographical locations of these tourist attractions.

<p>But how does one navigate to various tourist attractions? When you
look at the map, you find that certain kinds of tourist attractions tend
to cluster in space, such as the cluster of museums in the vicinity of
Space Needle and the cluster of older buildings around Smith Tower.
Different regions of Seattle with different vibes and functions are also
annotated on the map. There are historical reasons that led to such
spatial regions and clustering, such as the 1962 World’s Fair that gave
rise to the Space Needle. Here we see how locating the tourist
attractions in space point to a deeper understanding of the properties
of Seattle. Spatial transcriptomics is like studying a map of
Seattle.</p>

</h2>
Spatial transcriptomics helps us to make maps of the tissue, so just
like in the geographical map, we may locate characteristics of cells in
space and find spatial neighborhoods of cells. A working definition of
“spatial transcriptomics” is any attempt to quantify the transcripts of
more genes than can be done in one round of fluorescent <em>in situ</em>
hybridization (FISH) while preserving the spatial context of the gene
expression in the tissue. Since 2018, interest in spatial
transcriptomics – in both data collection and data analysis – has grown
drastically.
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="analysis-current-1.png" alt="Number of publications on spatial transcriptomics over time are shown as curves. The x axis is date published, and the y axis is number of publication in each 120 day time bin. The blue curve is for data collection papers, and the y axis is for data analysis papers. Both curves rise sharply since 2018." width="645"><p class="caption">
Number of publication over time for current era data collection and data
analysis. Bin width is 120 days. The x-shaped points show the number of
publications from the last bin, which is not yet full.
</p>
</div>
<p>Based on how the spatial context is preserved, spatial
transcriptomics data collection technologies fall into 5 categories,
sorted by extent of current usage (plot showing number of publications
per category), though there are gray areas:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="n-insts-1.png" alt="Bar chart showing the number of institutions using each spatial transcriptomics data collection method. Only methods used by at least 3 different institutions are shown. The bars are colored by category of the methods. 10X Visium (category NGS barcoding) is used by over 100 institutions, far more than any other method. Following Visium is GeoMX DSP (category ROI selection), used by over 20 institutions. 2016 ST and some other ROI selection methods follow, then ISS, then Stereo-seq and slide-seq2 (both NGS barcoding), then a number of smFISH based methods such as Molecular Cartography and MERFISH." width="645"><p class="caption">
Techniques used by at least 3 institutions and the number of
institutions that have used them.
</p>
</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Next generation sequencing (NGS) with spatial barcoding, where
spatial locations of the barcodes are known, such as 10X Visium,
Slide-seq, and Stereo-seq. Many of these methods, such as the popular
Visium, do not have single cell resolution. Hence cell type
deconvolution is commonly performed.</li>
<li>Region of interest (ROI) selection, where the act of specifying the
ROIs itself defines the spatial locations, such as laser capture
microdissection (LCM) followed by NGS and GeoMX DSP, where UV light is
used to cleave probes only in the selected ROIs for quantification. The
ROIs can also be sections in one spatial dimension, such as in Tomo-seq.
These methods also generally don’t have single cell resolution.</li>
<li>Single molecular FISH, where each detected transcript can be seen as
a discrete puncta and counted, such as MERFISH, seqFISH, and Molecular
Cartography. Combinatorial barcoding over multiple rounds – where
fluorescent probes are hybridized to the transcripts or cDNAs and color
or presence or absence of the probes are recorded and genes are identify
by the sequence of colors or presence/absence – is used to quantify more
genes than easily discernible colors simultaneously. Datasets from
highly multiplexed smFISH are usually not genome wide, and only quantify
a few hundred genes at a time, though these technologies have been used
in an increasing number of cells per experiment.</li>
<li>
<em>In situ</em> sequencing (ISS), which is similar to smFISH as the
transcripts are visualized as discrete puncta and counted. However, in
ISS, the gene barcodes are determined by <em>in situ</em> sequencing,
usually with sequencing by ligation, rather than with combinatorial
barcoding. smFISH and ISS based data have single cell resolution.</li>
<li>Spatial context is not directly recorded, but computationally
reconstructed, such as by recording pairwise spatial adjacency of cDNAs
as in DNA microscopy. In addition, the term “spatial” is sometimes used
to refer to sub-cellular resolution, such as in APEX-seq, where
transcripts are “localized” or organelles; since no spatial coordinates
are recorded, packages in this workshop may not be relevant to these
technologies.</li>

<p>Data analysis methods written for spatial transcriptomics can be
broadly categorized as upstream and downtream. In upstream analysis, the
raw data is converted into more usable forms, such as getting the gene
count matrix from fastq files and cell type deconvolution of Visium
spots. Downstream analysis begins with the more usable form of data for
further biological inferences, such as finding spatially variable genes,
spatial regions informed by gene expression, and cell-cell interactions.
<code>SpatialFeatureExperiment</code>, as a way to represent data, is
more upstream, while <code>Voyager</code>, for exploratory spatial data
analysis (ESDA), is a little more downstream.</p>
<p>In the literature when spatial transcriptomics data is generated, it
is often treated as non-spatial scRNA-seq data, and some data analysis
methods for spatial transcriptomics data do not take the spatial
information into account and are sometimes aimed at non-spatial data as
well. For example, most cell type deconvolution methods don’t take into
account spatial autocorrelation in cell type distribution, and
deconvolution methods for bulk RNA-seq is sometimes used for Visium
data. However, the spatial information presents many opportunities
unavailable to scRNA-seq, and this workshop will explore some of these
opportunities. Among the opporunities are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identifying spatial regions characterized by gene expression of cell
types, just like neighborhoods in geographical space. Many methods have
been written for this purpose.</li>
<li>Tissue and cellular morphology is available along side
transcriptomics, and may be related to gene expression. This is explored
a little in this workshop.</li>
<li>Explore how gene expression and quality control (QC) metrics vary in
space, such as strength, length scale, and direction (anisotropy) of
spatial autocorrelation. This workshop explores strength and length
scale of spatial autocorrelation; anisotropy will be supported in a
later version of the <code>Voyager</code> package.</li>

transcriptomics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#geospatial-data-types-and-how-they-may-relate-to-spatial-transcriptomics"></a>
</h2>
<p>Opportunities presented by spatial data can be explored by leveraging
a vast tradition of tools made for geospatial data. Geospatial data
broadly fall into two types by representation: vector and raster. Vector
data represents the world as points, lines, and polygons, specified by
coordinates. For example, polygons would be specified by coordinates of
the vertices. Raster data are basically images, where each pixel has a
value, though unlike the typical RGB image, raster data can have many
different layers analogous to the 3 channels in RGB images. Raster is
common in remote sensing.
<img src="spatial_types.png" title="Example image of different types of geospatial data: Areal, showing 7 day rolling mean covid cases per capita as of July 12, 2022 in Seattle. Geostatistical, showing zinc concentration measured at many points around the Meuse river. Network, showing Strava heatmap of road popularity among cyclists in Seattle. Point process, showing locations of copper mines and geological faults. Raster, showing an elevation map in Zion National Park. These data types are explained in the main text." alt="Example image of different types of geospatial data: Areal, showing 7 day rolling mean covid cases per capita as of July 12, 2022 in Seattle.

Point process, showing locations of copper mines and geological faults. Raster, showing an elevation map in Zion National Park. These data types are explained in the main text." width="665" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Vector data can be further classified by the processes generating the
data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Areal, where values are for entire areas (e.g. cities, zip codes)
rather than individuals. This is common in epidemiology to protect
patients’ privacy.</li>
<li>Geostatistical, where a spatial process (e.g. Gaussian process) is
sampled at points in space, and the locations of those points are known
and not of interest by themselves. Rather, the values are of interest.
An example is measurements of pollutant concentration at points in
space.</li>
<li>Point process, where the locations of occurrence is of interest,
such as where individuals of a species of plants occur. The locations
themselves are analyzed to find if they are randomly distributed,
clustered, or repelling each other, and if they are affected by
covariates.</li>
<li>When a phenomenon can only occur on a spatial network, such as roads
and rivers. This can be a point process, such as locations of traffic
incidents. This can also be analogous to raster data, such as <a href="https://www.strava.com/heatmap" class="external-link">Strava’s road/trail popularity
heatmap</a>, or areal when Strava’s heatmap is summarized over
segments.</li>
</ol>
<p>For each of these data types, there are already well-established
tools for data analysis. For example, <code>sf</code> represents vector
data and makes it behave like a data frame in R, <code>spdep</code> can
be used for spatial dependency of areal data, <code>INLA</code> can be
used for Bayesian spatial modeling, <code>gstat</code> is used for
interpolation with geostatistical data (kriging), <code>spatstat</code>
is used for point process data, <code>sfnetworks</code> for network
data, and <code>spatstat</code> supports point process analysis within a
network.</p>
<p>If we can relate these data types to spatial transcriptomics, then we
can take advantage of these data analysis tools:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Visium, LCM, and GeoMX DSP data aggregate transcript counts over
areas. In addition, in smFISH and ISS data, the counts are also often
aggregated over cells, and the cells are represented as polygons in
space. Here such data is analogous the areal data, although unlike for
cities and zip codes, the polygons may not be contiguous most of the
time.</li>
<li>If gene expression, or gene expression program, are imaged as
spatial processes, and the cells or Visium spots are imagined as points,
ignoring their area, then the data is analogous to geostatistical data.
(Shall I mention that R package using kriging)</li>
<li>Locations of transcript spots in smFISH and ISS based data, and
locations of cells and cell types can be thought of as spatial point
processes.</li>
<li>Spatial networks seem less relevant to spatial transcriptomics. One
potential use case is blood vessels. However, since spatial
transcriptomics data is usually obtained from thin sections of the
original 3D tissue, very little of the original 3D blood vessel network
remains in the section.</li>
<li>With the regular grids, Visium and 2016 Spatial Transcriptomics data
may be seen as a low resolution raster.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some geospatial data analysis methods have already been used in
spatial transcriptomics, such as Gaussian process regression (which
kriging is based on), Potts model, spatial point process analyses,
conditional autoregressive models, and global and local variants of
Moran’s I. (get the references) However, these sptial transcriptomics
packages and data analysis in the literature don’t fully explore the
opportunities given by the spatial information mentioned above, nor do
they always take advantage of the existing software infrastructure
originally built for geospatial data.</p>
<p>This workshop presents the packages
<code>SpatialFeatureExperiment</code> and <code>Voyager</code>, which
bring more of the existing vector geospatial data analysis tools to
spatial transcriptomics. <code>SpatialFeatureExperiment</code> (SFE)
implements a new S4 class extending <code>SpatialExperiment</code> with
<code>sf</code> data frames representing cell or Visium spot polygons,
geometries of other objects, anatomical regions, and tissue boundaries,
and spatial neighborhood graphs. <code>Voyager</code> to SFE is just
like <code>scater</code>, <code>scran</code>, and <code>scuttle</code>
to <code>SingleCellExperiment</code>, implementing basic ESDA using
well-established geospatial tools and plotting functions for geometries
and ESDA results. With <code>sf</code>, we focus on vector areal data
here, because of the popularity of Visium, and that although the
fluorsecent or H&amp;E images are raster, vector features extracted from
the images, such as cell and nuclei segmentation, and transcript spots,
are more commonly used for downstream analyses.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-and-future-directions">Limitations and future directions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#limitations-and-future-directions"></a>
</h2>
<p>No analogy is perfect, and these are some limitations of the
geospatial analogy that would call for data analysis methods specific to
spatial transcriptomics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Biological tissues are usually originally 3D. Although most spatial
transcriptomics datasets come from thin sections, some datasets come
from thicker sections. However, the z dimension usually has much lower
resolution than x and y if present, and might need to be treated
differently. Geospatial tools and resources are very focused on 2D. If
3D support is present (e.g. 3D spatial point processes in
<code>spatstat</code>), the support may be limited.</li>
<li>Spatial transcriptomics datasets can get much larger than most
geospatial vector datasets, from thousands of genes and thousands to
millions of cells or spots. There should be more emphasis on
multivariate spatial analyses, which we plan to add to a later version
of <code>Voyager</code>. On disk tools exist for geospatial data, but
are not supported by SFE yet.</li>
<li>Unlike cities and natural landscapes, development and structure of
some tissues (e.g. the cerebral cortex) are tightly regulated and
similar across individuals.</li>
